Package that contains classes that allow abstracting out of details of
JDK platform version being used. Currently classes are used to implement
"graceful degradation" of functionality, when certain JDK classes are only
fully implemented as part of JDKs later than the minimum version Woodstox
needs for running (which is currently 1.2).
